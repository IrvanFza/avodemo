### Visit the live app on [main.avodemo.com](https://main.avodemo.com/)

This is a demo app to show how simple it is to integrate [Avo](https://avohq.io) in your app.

Have a look at the [/avo](/app/avo) directory to find the resources, filters and actions.

```bash
bin/dev
```

### Run app

```bash
bin/dev
# or
bin/rails serve
```
